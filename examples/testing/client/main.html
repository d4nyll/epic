# Welcome to `d4nyll:epic`!

So Meteor already has a [`markdown`](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/markdown) package that lets you write in Markdown.

But what if you'd like to let users write in Markdown too? Like this one below!
{{/markdown}}
{{> epic}}
{{#markdown}}
The editor above was added simply by placing &#x7B;&#x7B;&#x3E;&#x20;&#x65;&#x70;&#x69;&#x63;&#x7D;&#x7D; inside the template, which will output something like this: `{{> epic}}`

If you inspect this page, you will see the `textarea`, which is `display: none` by default. It will sync its content to the text area as you type.

Other stuff:

1. <a href="./epicMultiple">You can have multiple editors on the same page</a>
2. <a href="./epicCreate">Customize the look using your own theme</a>

<sub>
This editor is a Meteor package built around [EpicEditor](https://github.com/OscarGodson/EpicEditor).
